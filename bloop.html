		<p class="mb-2">The Hyperloop is a transportation concept that envisions sending a levitating aluminum pod 760 miles per hour to efficiently transport people between locations. Billionaire Elon Musk sponsored a competition to challenge student teams to build a functional pod and test it on his private track at SpaceX. I joined the UC Berkeley team to hop right in the action! ðŸš€</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">I led a team of 60+ UC Berkeley engineers to build a Hyperloop pod in six weeks and under a budget of $9k. I engaged leads at other student organization to learn about their manufacturing processes, and convinced vendors and suppliers to create partnerships and sponsorships. During the competition, I explained the team's design and manufacturing decisions to SpaceX engineers.</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">Due to budget restrictions, it was impossible to build a carbon fiber pod using the traditional process which was being used by most teams (female mold created with fiberglass and expensive CNC'ed foam). I used my experience as a Product Development Engineer to ideate a custom manufacturing process and design the required tooling. The solution was a male mold made with aluminum sheet metal and fixtures, much like the fuselage of modern planes. </p>
