		<p class="mb-2">Drinks4Snaps was an experiment I conducted to test if small businesses could grow by incentivizing their current customers to promote through word of mouth. I got the idea for this project after a local restaurant owner told me their new Sunday brunch was failing, and asked for actionable insight into attracting new student customers. </p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">I partnered with two local restaurant owners and designed an experiment to have students promote businesses on Snapchat in exchange for discounts. I created a website to explain the experiment and recruit students, promoting it through social media and by distributing flyers on campus. In one week I signed up over 200 students willing to participate.</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">I ran the experiment during four Sundays in a row, varying the discounts offered to students each time to analyze the impact on participation. On the most succesful day, 30 students promoted the business, generating an increase in daily revenue of $1,000 and $2,000 worth of Snapchat views</p>
