		<p class="mb-2">Marketers pay big $$$ to influencers on social media to get their products promoted, but it's hard for them to know what they're getting in return for their investment.</p>
		<p>I made LikeWallet to try and solve that problem. The web app connects with Instagram to track the posts of influencers of your choice. Not only can you view how many likes and views their posts are getting, but you can also get demographic information about the people seeing the posts, as well as how many of them are clicking through to your website.</p>
