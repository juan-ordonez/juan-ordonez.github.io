		<p class="mb-2">Current rovers weigh thousands of pounds. Not only are they extremely expensive to send to space, but they are also unable to navigate rough terrain without breaking. Tensegrities are flexible structures made of bars and tensioned cables. In a project sponsored by NASA, I teamed up with three engineers to transform a Tensegrity structure into a lightweight flexible robot capable of moving around and absorbing strong drop impacts. </p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">I designed and rapid-prototyped all the hardware for the robot, including the packaging and mounts for the circuit boards, batteries, motors and other electronic components. The biggest challenge was minimizing the amount of force transferred to the electronics during impacts from drops, while keeping the disassembly process simple to allow for quick testing and iteration.</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">Once the robot was fully assembled, I tested and developed different actuation schemes for locomotion. This was very challenging because there are 6.2 x10^23 number of different actuation combinations to make the robot move. I simplified the problem by testing a subset of combinations and extrapolating the rest by analyzing the symmetry of the robot's structure.</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">I managed and supervised two undergraduate engineering researchers who were interested in the project. I gave them different hands-on tasks throughout the project such as designing components needed for testing. I taught them how to improve their CAD models and how to prototype using 3D printers.</p>
